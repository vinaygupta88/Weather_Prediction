<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
    The Weather Prediction app is a machine learning-based web application 
    designed  to forecast weather-related conditions like temperature, 
    based on input parameters such as humidity, pressure, and wind speed.
</p>

<p>
    Our goal is to provide a simple and effective tool for quick weather
    insights using real-time data. The predictions are powered by a trained 
    ML model integrated into this Django-powered website.
